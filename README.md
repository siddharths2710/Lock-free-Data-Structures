# Lock-free-Data-Structures

This repo contains our version of several thread-safe implementations of well known data structures and patterns.

## Procedure

* Every implementation is C++ based. To compile each project please make use of the Makefile with the `make` command ( make changes to the makefile to take care of different C++ compiler ).

* Every implementation also has a client file to illustrate its working in a multi-threaded environment. Be sure to use that as a reference for using our implementation.
